# Not needed for this example, but best practice noted
Best Practice Recommendation: In general, all observations should have a performer

# deprecation noted
The discriminator type 'pattern' is deprecated in R5+. For future compatibility, you could consider using type=value with a pattern[x] instead (if this is not an inherited slicing)

# noted in example. 
Best Practice Recommendation: In general, all observations should have an effective[x] ()
