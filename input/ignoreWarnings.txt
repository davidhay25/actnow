# Not needed for this example, but best practice noted
Best Practice Recommendation: In general, all observations should have a performer

# deprecation noted
The discriminator type 'pattern' is deprecated in R5+. For future compatibility, you could consider using type=value with a pattern[x] instead (if this is not an inherited slicing)

# noted in example. 
Best Practice Recommendation: In general, all observations should have an effective[x] ()

# not clear where this ValueSet is being referenced. Not significant in this implementation
There are multiple different potential matches for the url 'http://terminology.hl7.org/ValueSet/v3-ActSubstanceAdminSubstitutionCode'. It might be a good idea to fix to the correct version to reduce the likelihood of a wrong version being selected by an implementation/implementer. Using version '3.0.0', found versions: 2014-03-26, 3.0.0
